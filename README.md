# EDA_Video_Game_Sales_CaseStudy
Meticulously curated and cleansed data, orchestrating a columnwise exploratory data analysis (EDA). Employed Python for  sophisticated data manipulation, subsequently deriving insightful conclusions. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on video game sales data. The dataset used in this study contains information about the sales of various video games across different platforms, regions, and genres.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study is the [Video Game Sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/videogamesales), which contains the following columns:

- Rank: The rank of the game in terms of sales.
- Name: The name of the game.
- Platform: The platform on which the game was released.
- Year: The year of release.
- Genre: The genre of the game.
- Publisher: The publisher of the game.
- NA\_Sales: The sales in North America.
- EU\_Sales: The sales in Europe.
- JP\_Sales: The sales in Japan.
- Other\_Sales: The sales in other regions.
- Global\_Sales: The total sales across all regions.

## EDA

The EDA performed in this study includes the following:

- Checking the first few rows of the dataset.
- Checking the data types and missing values in the dataset.
- Checking the number of unique values in the Platform column.
- Checking the earliest and latest years of release and the sales in various regions during those years.
- Checking the most frequent platform and its performance during the years in global sales and individual sales.

## Results

The EDA performed in this study revealed the following insights:

- The dataset contains 16,598 entries and 11 columns.
- The Platform column has 31 unique values.
- The earliest year of release is 1980 and the latest year of release is 2020.
- The platform with the earliest release is the 2600 and the platform with the latest release is the DS.
- The platform with the most frequent release is the DS, with 2,131 entries.
- The platform with the earliest release had considerable sales in various parts of the world, but the latest release did not have a lot of sales compared to the earliest.

## Conclusion

The EDA performed in this study provides insights into the video game sales dataset and can be used to inform further analysis and decision-making. The dataset can be used to analyze trends in video game sales across different platforms, regions, and genres.
